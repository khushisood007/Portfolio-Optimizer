# Portfolio Optimization using Python (2023–2025)

A Python-based Portfolio Optimization System using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to maximize returns and minimize risk.  
It analyzes 2023–2025 Yahoo Finance data with PyPortfolioOpt to calculate expected returns, volatility, and optimal weights, and visualizes efficient portfolio allocation.

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how to construct an optimized stock portfolio using **real-world financial data**.  
It applies **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to determine the most efficient asset combination that offers the highest return for a given level of risk.

The analysis is based on stock data from **Yahoo Finance**, covering the period **January 2023 – December 2025**.  
The project calculates key financial metrics such as **expected annual return**, **volatility**, **covariance**, and **Sharpe ratio**, then identifies the optimal portfolio weights.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Expected Return** — Average return of a stock based on past performance  
- **Risk (Volatility)** — How much a stock’s price fluctuates over time  
- **Sharpe Ratio** — Measures return per unit of risk  
- **Efficient Frontier** — The set of portfolios offering the best possible risk–return balance
